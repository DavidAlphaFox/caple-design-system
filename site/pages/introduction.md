## :rocket: Getting started

If you're looking for React components, take a look at [@caplt-ui/react](http://github.com/cobaltinc/caple-design-system/blob/master/package/react).
If you want to only iconography assets, checkout [@capl-ui/icons-react](http://github.com/cobaltinc/caple-design-system/blob/master/packages/icons-react).

There are no packages for Vue.js and Angular yet. We plan to release them later.
